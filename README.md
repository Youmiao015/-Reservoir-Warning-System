# Reservoir-Warning-System
## Objective
A solution based on Machine Learning (ML) and statistical methods for the issue of N (nitrogen)超标 in northern Chinese reservoirs
## Data Source
National Water Quality Monitoring Stations
## Method
• Established an online early warning system for nitrogen by data analysis, multivariate statistics, machine
learning, and deep learning methods.
• Structured and normalized raw data and extracted data features by Principal Component Analysis(PCA).
• Investigated and determined decision-making factors in water quality real-time monitoring system by Random
Forest approach, to make the key factors have higher precision and high ability to distinguish.
• Designed different neural network structures to train and test models, including RNN, GRU, and LSTM.
• Improved model accuracy by optimizing the loss function and utilizing the confusion matrix, and improve
model interpretability based on the anthropogenic data.
